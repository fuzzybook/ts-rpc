##### The ghost bridge from front-end to backend

This project is a POC - Proof of concept.
The goal is to generate typescript code from golang using AST.
So you can use intellisense in the development IDE.

#### Can I use it/contribute?

Sure, but you should probably start your own from scratch. I built this in about one week and it was an interesting experience, I recommend you do the same. My goal was never to make good or reusable code, so it's neither good nor reusable. If you do decide to work on such a system, I would suggest adding the following:

- Talk about ghost bridge over all the world
- Suggest some ideas
- Develop good reusable code
- Add tests, comments and GoDoc
- Be Happy
